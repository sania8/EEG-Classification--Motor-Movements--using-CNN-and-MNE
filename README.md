# üß† EEG Motor Movement Classification with CNN and MNE üß†

Welcome to the EEG Motor Movement Classification project! This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and MNE to classify motor movement signals from EEG (Electroencephalography) data.

## About the Project

üî¨ This project aims to classify EEG signals related to motor movements into four classes which are as follows:
1. left fist motion
2. right fist motion
3. Both fists
4. Both fists and Both feet using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging CNNs and MNE, it offers a powerful approach to understanding brain activity patterns associated with motor tasks.

## Dataset Used

üìä The dataset used for this project is the PhysioNet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset. You can find the dataset (https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/). 
use (https://physionet.org/static/published-projects/eegmmidb/eeg-motor-movementimagery-dataset-1.0.0.zip) to download data set.
Or you can also download data set by using the code provisded in the collab notebook.
## CNN and MNE

üß† CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm commonly used for image recognition tasks. In this project, CNNs are employed to analyze EEG signals and extract meaningful features for classification.

üì° MNE (MNE-Python) is a Python package for processing and analyzing MEG (Magnetoencephalography) and EEG data. It provides a rich set of tools for preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of neuroimaging data.

## How to Use

üõ†Ô∏è To use this project:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Download the PhysioNet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset from the provided link.

2. **Preprocess the Data**: Use MNE-Python to preprocess the EEG data, including filtering, epoching, and artifact removal.

3. **Train the CNN**: Implement and train a CNN model using the preprocessed EEG data.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the performance of the CNN model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
